# Introduction
Deno (/ˈdiːnoʊ/, pronounced dee-no) is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with secure defaults and a great developer experience.

It's built on V8, Rust, and `Tokio`.

## Feature highlights
- Web compatible where possible, for example through usage of ES modules, and support for fetch.
- Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access (unless explicitly enabled).
- Supports TypeScript out of the box.
 - Ships a single executable (deno).
- Has built-in utilities like a code formatter (deno fmt), a linter (deno lint), and a test runner (deno test).
- Has a set of reviewed (audited) standard library that are guaranteed to work with Deno.
- Can bundle scripts into a single JavaScript file.
